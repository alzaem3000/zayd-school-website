# School Performance Charter System
## نظام ميثاق الأداء الوظيفي

### Current Status: ✅ COMPLETE & FUNCTIONAL

The application is a Saudi Ministry of Education-compliant Performance Charter (ميثاق الأداء الوظيفي) system with two indicator types (Goals & Competencies), weighted scoring, mandatory teacher onboarding, and ministry-standard printable charter reports.

## What Was Built

### ✅ Complete Features Implemented:

1. **Authentication System**
   - Replit OAuth integration (Google, GitHub, Email)
   - Session management with PostgreSQL session store
   - Token refresh and expiration handling
   - Protected routes and API endpoints
   - Role-based access control (Teacher/Principal)

2. **Database Layer**
   - 13 tables: users, sessions, indicators, criteria, witnesses, strategies, userStrategies, capabilities, changes, signatures, academicCycles, auditLogs, notifications, performanceStandards
   - Users: fullNameArabic, jobNumber, specialization, mobileNumber, onboardingCompleted fields
   - Indicators: type (goal/competency), weight (1-100%), domain (values/knowledge/practice), targetOutput
   - Performance Standards: 11 ministry-standard records with dynamic API (GET /api/standards)
   - PostgreSQL with Neon serverless
   - Drizzle ORM with TypeScript types
   - 18 strategies, 12 capabilities, 12 changes, 11 performance standards pre-seeded

3. **Onboarding System**
   - Mandatory teacher profile completion before system access
   - Mobile number field with Saudi format validation (05XXXXXXXX) - required during onboarding
   - Mobile number displayed in teacher profile cards
   - Mobile number editable in profile edit form
   - Duplicate prevention: mobile number-based account merge with session migration
   - Job number validation (numeric, 4+ digits)
   - Arabic full name required
   - Specialization, school, department, subject fields
   - Automatic redirect until onboarding is complete

4. **Performance Charter (ميثاق الأداء)**
   - Two indicator types: Goals (أهداف الأداء الوظيفي) and Competencies (الجدارات المهنية)
   - Weighted scoring system totaling 100% per category
   - Weight validation with visual progress bars
   - Tab-based dashboard separating Goals and Competencies
   - Domain classification for competencies (values/knowledge/practice)
   - Target output field for goals
   - Official ministry-format printable charter report

5. **Multi-Role System**
   - **Creator Role** (منشئ الموقع): Site-wide user management, assign any role to users, all principal permissions
   - **Principal/Admin Role**: View all teachers, approve/reject indicators, school-wide statistics
   - **Supervisor Role**: Future expansion for department oversight
   - **Teacher Role**: Create indicators, manage criteria, add witnesses, submit for approval
   - Role hierarchy: creator > admin > supervisor > teacher
   - Automatic role-based routing
   - Data isolation between teachers

6. **Signature Approval Workflow**
   - Teachers submit completed indicators for principal approval
   - Status tracking: pending → approved/rejected
   - Principal can add approval notes
   - Rejection requires reason

7. **Smart Evidence System (مساعد الشواهد الذكي)**
   - Dynamic performance standards loaded from database (GET /api/standards) - 11 ministry standards
   - Fallback to local constants if database unavailable
   - `witness-upload-modal.tsx`: Split-view layout with upload area + smart evidence suggestions (replaces old AddWitnessModal)
   - `evidence-review-modal.tsx`: Split-view with file preview + rubric checklist for principals
   - Standards matched to indicator titles automatically
   - Suggested evidence list from ministry standards
   - Smart cards for witness list: colored icon backgrounds (red=PDF, green=image, blue=video), file type badges
   - Clicking witness card opens split-view EvidenceReviewModal directly (principal dashboard)

8. **Automatic Image Compression**
   - Uses `browser-image-compression` library
   - Compresses uploaded images to max 0.8MB, max 1920px dimension
   - Shows compression progress with spinner animation
   - Displays before/after file size comparison
   - Non-image files pass through uncompressed
   - Integrated into WitnessUploadModal (split-view)

9. **Grid of Cards UI**
   - Teacher dashboard: 3-column responsive grid (lg:3, md:2, sm:1)
   - Principal dashboard: 3-column grid for indicators + 2-column smart cards for witness list
   - Status-colored right borders (green=completed, amber=in_progress, gray=pending)
   - Indicator-specific icons map (not generic) for both dashboards
   - Icon + title + weight badge card headers with Progress component
   - Skeleton loading states for cards
   - Empty state placeholders with call-to-action buttons
   - Pending signatures: card grid with teacher avatar, indicator icon, progress bar, approve/reject buttons
   - Witness smart cards: 2-column grid with colored icon backgrounds + file type badges

10. **Frontend Application**
    - Landing page (non-authenticated users)
    - Teacher dashboard (/home) with Grid of Cards
    - Onboarding page (/onboarding) with mobile number field
    - Principal dashboard (/principal) with Grid of Cards
    - Indicator management (CRUD operations)
    - Witness/evidence management with smart suggestions
    - Strategies selection interface
    - Full RTL Arabic interface
    - Light/dark theme toggle
    - Responsive design
    - CSS print media queries (hide sidebar/buttons during print, full-page charter)
    - Offline awareness banner (detects network loss, warns user about unsaved changes)

11. **Backend API**
    - 20+ REST endpoints
    - Stats aggregation for both roles
    - Indicator CRUD with criteria tracking
    - Signature management
    - Principal-only protected endpoints
    - User profile management
    - Dynamic standards API (GET /api/standards)
